#### readme for level 1 unique and duplicate in arrays

# The Story So Far...
You are in the hallway of a dungeon.

In front of you are ten doorways.

Behind each door is not only a treasure chest (likely containing an artifact that you need) but also a elemental swarm!

An elemental swarm is like a swarm of flying insects, only, because it is an enchanted swarm of elementals, it is more like a swarm of fire pixies or forest pixies, or ice pixies, or a swarm of many kinds of pixies all mixed together.

And the thing is...if you attack a swarm, much like attacking a hornet's nest, the swarm will all attack you right back! And like ants or bees...or spiders, just one may be very small and not to worry about. But a swarm may be hundreds, or thousands, or millions, or more.

The good thing is that if the swarm are all (or mostly) of the same element, and you have a spell that can take care of that element, well then you can eliminate the whole swarm with just that one simple spell. Problem solved!

But if your spell only neutralizes half the swarm, and makes the other half even more powerful, well then your little spell might have landed you in a bit of trouble.

So your challenge, being a clever adventurer who thinks before they act, is to find out what elements make up these swarms that you are about to face. And you should only try to deal with the swarms that you can safely neutralize. Which means you should only approach the swarms that are all (or mostly) made of the same element.

# Now, let's talk planning details!
More specifically, for each room, for the swarm in each room, you will be looking at a list (or array) of all the elements in that swarm. And, specifically, you will want to find out the number of 'unique' and 'duplicate' elements in that swarm. If the number of unique elements is 1, that's grand, and if the number of duplicates is the same as the total, then everything is a duplicate of the same element, it's all the same kind of pixie, just use your simple spell, easy peasy.

But what if there are two unique elements, meaning two kinds of elemental pixies. Then you will need to know how many of each are there? If there is just one then that's ok, you can handle just one little pixie. But if there are lots of two types, then you will want to steer clear of that room for now.

# In summary...
In order to make your strategy for which of the ten dungeon rooms you will try to tackle, you will need to write a program that gives you a report on each room, telling you:

1. How many pixies are in the swarm in total.
2. How many unique types of elemental pixies there are.
3. And how many pixies there are for each element you find.

Once you know this, you can try your luck, or try your strategy, and see if you can get past those pixies to get what is in the chest.
