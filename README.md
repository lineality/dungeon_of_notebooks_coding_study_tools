readme.md for dungeon_of_notebooks_coding_study_tools

Note: This project is 'Dungeon of Notebooks'. On the other hand, http://ReadMeAdventures.com/ or https://lineality.github.io/readmeadventures.github.io/ is a different but similar story-based coding study tool. Read-Me-Adventures is focused on using command-line terminals rather than python-coding-Notebooks. Read-Me-Adventures focuses on projects such as Natural Language Processing rather than computer-science interview questions or 'code challenges.'

# Dungeon of Notebooks 

Dungeon of Notebooks is a blending of python notebooks, code-challenges or coding-interview questions, and story based games or RPG Dungeon games (role playing games).

Each notebook contains a code challenge designed to teach and practice a programming skill. Each coding puzzle is framed in the context of a story scenario, so each code-puzzle is also a scene in a story. The idea is that a story will help to make the puzzle more concrete, interesting, and visibly applicable, and less arbitrary and meaningless. 

The plan is to offer a set of notebooks that cover code-interview and computer science curriculum skills and abilities. Challenges that elsewhere are one single more advanced challenge here may be broken up into parts. There will also be a theme of practice through cumulative repetition. The goal is not to solve one puzzle once, but to train to build habits around skills over time and many iterations. 

An example approach to covering a Computer Science, Programing, and Coding curriculum can be found here: https://github.com/lineality/cs-computer-science-curriculum 

An 'intro / starter' notebook is here, to start story and introduce how notebooks are used:

General Puzzle Types:
1. Map & Directions puzzles
- strings

2. item inventory puzzles
- 

3. team strategy puzzles
- data structures (linked lists)
- chain of communication

4. cast of creatures puzzles
	- comparing populations in rooms

5. dungeon rooms and spell effects
- matrices 

6. spell books:
- strings


### Notes:
1. "cut-up" style puzzles where, for a group activity, different users/students are given different parts of a large puzzle which they then communicate and collaborate to put together.

2. basic skills and full interview questions

3. solving a problem 'from scratch' without using built-in or public tools, etc. Python has many such high-level built-in functions, vs. learning to use the built-in tools. Maybe analogous to doing math with pen and paper at first before using functions built into calculators and software.  

4. automatic generation of new problems for practice?

5. Q: Files and folders? useful, but not usually included...
