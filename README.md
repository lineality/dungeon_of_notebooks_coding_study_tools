## readme.md for dungeon_of_notebooks_coding_study_tools

*Note: This project is 'Dungeon of Notebooks'. A different but similar story-based coding-study tool is ReadMe-Adventures: http://ReadMeAdventures.com/ or https://lineality.github.io/readmeadventures.github.io/ . Read-Me-Adventures is focused on using command-line terminals rather than python-coding-Notebooks. Read-Me-Adventures focuses on projects such as Natural Language Processing rather than computer-science interview questions or 'code challenges.'*


# Dungeon of Notebooks 

Dungeon of Notebooks is a blending of python notebooks, code-challenges (coding-interview questions), and story based games or RPG Dungeon games (role playing games).

Each coding-notebook contains a code-puzzle (or code challenge) designed to teach and practice a specific programming skill. Each code-puzzle is framed in the context of a story scenario, so each code-puzzle is also a scene in a story. The idea is that a story will help to make the puzzle more concrete, interesting, and applicable in real-life scenarios, and connected to the world we live in (or read about in literature). This should address the problem of code challenges being difficult to understand or solve when they are excessively arbitrary and disconnected. 

The plan is to offer a whole set of notebooks that cover a whole curriculum of code-interview and computer science curriculum skills and abilities. Challenges that elsewhere are one single more advanced challenge here may be broken up into smaller parts (before being cumulatively reviewed together). There will also be a theme of practice through cumulative repetition, with an option of additional practice puzzles in skill areas where students want more practice. The goal is not to solve one puzzle once and then never mention it again, but to train to build habits around applicable skills over time and many iterations because they are broadly applicable and repeated use deepens our skills and understanding.. 


# Notebooks:

An introductory notebook is here, to start the story and introduce how notebooks are used:

An example colab-notebook that pulls from code to visualize the dungeon room and scenario is here:

# Curricula 

An example approach to covering a Computer Science, Programing, and Coding curriculum can be found here: https://github.com/lineality/cs-computer-science-curriculum 

An example approach to integrating problem solving skills and team-coordination project skills into study materials which will be important for Dungeon of Notebooks is here:

# Story Puzzles and Coding Challenges

Code-Challenges (or 'Coding Interview Questions') alone can often seem abstract and confusing due to the lack of a concrete context where they are part of solving a clear problem. 
Here each Code-Challenge is explained in terms of a concrete story situation with a concrete and understandable outcome. 

For example,  you will deal with such things as a cast of characters, casts of creatures in dungeon rooms, enchanted items and tools, maps and pathways through the dungeon, scrolls of spells and information about creatures or dungeon rooms, etc. Whether you are able to 'solve the problem' will ultimately mean, concretely, being able to get artifacts from a chest in a room. If you fail, you can clearly see how you failed in terms of what should have happened but did not happen in terms of concrete actions, items, and relationships in a coherent story setting. 


# How Spells & Elements work in Dungeon of Notebooks:

Part of the story-logic-puzzles for this game is a system of 'elements' based on the eastern 5-element system, where each element helps one other element and hinders one other element. Each creature has an element, and each spell has an element. You will need to pick which element you use in each case to make sure the effect is what you plan on.

# Gameplay Workflow

Every "lesson" (an interview question) is a "level" in the dungeon, involving one or more rooms for which you will have to develop a function in order to get the items you need from the chests to complete that level. For example, a function that helps you to determine what spell you need to cast.


# Interface: Graphics & Text, GUI & TUI
To help make events concrete, there is a graphical display of what is happening in the dungeon room. In particular where the characters, creatures, and treasure chests are. For navigating freeling around the dungeon and rooms there will be a Text-User-Interface (or TUI) where the player will type in their actions. 




# Puzzle & Activity Examples: 
#### Where each puzzle will result in a successful or failed attempt to get to items from a chest in a dungeon-room. 

The first interview question based set of lessons (aside from tutorial and pre-requisite skill lessons) focuses on unique or duplicate items in lists and arrays. 

1. Map & Directions puzzles
- strings 
- lists
- graphs 
- trees

2. Item Inventory Puzzles
- stacks
- queues

3. Team Strategy Puzzles
- linked lists
- chains of communication

4. cast of creatures puzzles
- comparing populations in rooms

5. dungeon rooms and spell effects
- matrices 

6. spell books:
- strings
- lists

### + Additional Study Areas 

1. Directory & Files Basics Dungeon Rooms

2. SQL Dungeon Rooms

3. Probability & Statistics Dungeon Rooms


# Stories, Lessons & Overall Educational Framework
To fit into an overall game, overall curricula, and overall set of teaching method standards, each specific focused skill-lesson will have the following: 
	
1. coding interview question code-challenge
2. Literary Scene
3. Interview Question Curriculum
4. SUPER-Scrum-Liberal-Arts 1. SUPER
5. SUPER-Scrum-Liberal-Arts 2. Scrum, team
6. SUPER-Scrum-Liberal-Arts 3. Liberal-Arts Culture Content
7. Concrete Dungeon RPG Scenario Puzzle
8. Genre (Dungeon, Science Fiction, etc.)
9. (Classroom Structure) Genre Setting, involving 1,2, or 3 players (OOC) and 6 Characters (in-character)
10. Concrete Action, usually resulting (if puzzle is solved correctly) with getting the contents of one or more room-chests.
11. A working dungeon game interface with a coherent overall dungeon experience from lesson to less, interactive
12. Extra-Study Randomly generated or augmented Puzzles for that Specific-Skill-Lesson
13. (Lesson Structure) Story Game (e.g. DoN)
Overall Game System
14. Lesson Structure) Course (e.g. Tech Interview Questions)
Overall Course of Study
15. (Lesson Structure) Course Section (e.g. Data Structures)
Like a chapter in a textbooks
16. (Lesson Structure) General Skill Lesson Group (e.g. All About: Duplicates)
Overall Puzzle Set, usually with Many Sub-Parts that need to be further broken down
Not Single Metric Answer Quantified
17. (Lesson Structure) Specific  Skill Lesson (e.g. How many Duplicates are there?)
One specific skill for one specific question (often part of a larger problem)
Single Metric Answer Quantified
18. Problems have concrete situational solutions, whereby you solve the puzzle and are able to proceed with the story or not.



### Notes:
1. "cut-up" style puzzles where, for a group activity, different users/students are given different parts of a large puzzle which they then communicate and collaborate to put together.

2. basic skills and full interview questions

3. solving a problem 'from scratch' without using built-in or public tools, etc. Python has many such high-level built-in functions, vs. learning to use the built-in tools. Maybe analogous to doing math with pen and paper at first before using functions built into calculators and software.  

4. automatic generation of new problems for practice?

5. Q: Files and folders? useful, but not usually included...


## Questions to Guide the Choice of an Educational Course:
1. What is the content?
2. What are the methods standards?
3. How is formative evaluation done?
4. How is summative evaluation done?
5. How are training and certification distinct?
6. Is the process inclusive on all levels?
7. How are data used in decision making?


## Portfolios, Github Repos, and Mini-Projects

The last step in each puzzle, after you have gotten into the treasure chests and finished the story episode, is to create a project repository (a "repo") for the coding-solution that you created.

Basic steps are:
1. clone this repo
https://github.com/lineality/Code_Solution_For_TEMPLATE-YOUR-MINI-PROJECT-NAME-HERE

2. add a title and fill in the template to describe your solution
3. make a new repo for your solution (e.g. in Github)
4. upload your files
5. Write an article such as a blog post explaining how you solved the problem, for example teaching someone else how to do so. Teaching something is a core part of learning that thing.
