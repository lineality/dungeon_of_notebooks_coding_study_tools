## readme.md for dungeon_of_notebooks_coding_study_tools

*Note: This project is 'Dungeon of Notebooks'. On the other hand, http://ReadMeAdventures.com/ or https://lineality.github.io/readmeadventures.github.io/ is a different but similar story-based coding study tool. Read-Me-Adventures is focused on using command-line terminals rather than python-coding-Notebooks. Read-Me-Adventures focuses on projects such as Natural Language Processing rather than computer-science interview questions or 'code challenges.'*

# Dungeon of Notebooks 

Dungeon of Notebooks is a blending of python notebooks, code-challenges (coding-interview questions), and story based games or RPG Dungeon games (role playing games).

Each notebook contains a code challenge designed to teach and practice a programming skill. Each coding puzzle is framed in the context of a story scenario, so each code-puzzle is also a scene in a story. The idea is that a story will help to make the puzzle more concrete, interesting, and visibly applicable, and less arbitrary and meaningless. 

The plan is to offer a set of notebooks that cover code-interview and computer science curriculum skills and abilities. Challenges that elsewhere are one single more advanced challenge here may be broken up into parts. There will also be a theme of practice through cumulative repetition. The goal is not to solve one puzzle once, but to train to build habits around skills over time and many iterations. 

An example approach to covering a Computer Science, Programing, and Coding curriculum can be found here: https://github.com/lineality/cs-computer-science-curriculum 

An introductory notebook is here, to start the story and introduce how notebooks are used:

## Story Puzzles and Coding Challenges
Code-Challenges (or 'Coding Interview Questions') alone can often seem abstract and confusing due to the lack of a concrete context where they are part of solving a clear problem. 
Here each Code-Challenge is explained in terms of a concrete story situation with a concrete and understandable outcome. 

For example,  you will deal with such things as a cast of characters, casts of creatures in dungeon rooms, enchanted items and tools, maps and pathways through the dungeon, scrolls of spells and information about creatures or dungeon rooms, etc. Whether you are able to 'solve the problem' will ultimately mean, concretely, being able to get artifacts from a chest in a room. If you fail, you can clearly see how you failed in terms of what should have happened but did not happen in terms of concrete actions, items, and relationships in a coherent story setting. 




## How Spells & Elements work in Dungeon of Notebooks:
Part of the story-logic-puzzles for this game is a system of 'elements' based on the eastern 5-element system, where each element helps one other element and hinders one other element. Each creature has an element, and each spell has an element. You will need to pick which element you use in each case to make sure the effect is what you plan on.

## Graphics
To help make events concrete, there is a (low tech) graphical display of what is happening in the dungeon room. In particular where the characters and creatures are, the characters.
(what elements are?)


### Puzzle & Activity Examples: 
#### Where each puzzle will result in a successful or failed attempt to get to items from a chest in a dungeon-room. 

1. Map & Directions puzzles
- strings 
- lists
- graphs 
- trees

2. Item Inventory Puzzles
- stacks
- queues

3. Team Strategy Puzzles
- linked lists
- chains of communication

4. cast of creatures puzzles
- comparing populations in rooms

5. dungeon rooms and spell effects
- matrices 

6. spell books:
- strings
- lists

## Stories, Lessons & Overall Framework
To fit into an overall game, overall curricula, and overall set of teaching method standards, each specific focused skill-lesson will have the following: 
	
1.	coding interview question code-challenge
2.	Literary Scene
3.	Interview Question Curriculum
4.	SUPER-Scrum-Liberal-Arts 1. SUPER
5.	SUPER-Scrum-Liberal-Arts 2. Scrum, team
6.	SUPER-Scrum-Liberal-Arts 3. Liberal-Arts Culture Content
7.	Concrete Dungeon RPG Scenario Puzzle
8.	Genre (Dungeon, Science Fiction, etc.)
9.	(Classroom Structure) Genre Setting, involving 1,2, or 3 players (OOC) and 6 Characters (in-character)
10. Concrete Action, usually resulting (if puzzle is solved correctly) with getting the contents of one or more room-chests.
11.	A working dungeon game interface with a coherent overall dungeon experience from lesson to less, interactive
12.	Extra-Study Randomly generated or augmented Puzzles for that Specific-Skill-Lesson
13.	(Lesson Structure) Story Game (e.g. DoN)
Overall Game System
14.	Lesson Structure) Course (e.g. Tech Interview Questions)
Overall Course of Study
15.	(Lesson Structure) Course Section (e.g. Data Structures)
Like a chapter in a textbooks
16.	(Lesson Structure) General Skill Lesson Group (e.g. All About: Duplicates)
Overall Puzzle Set, usually with Many Sub-Parts that need to be further broken down
Not Single Metric Answer Quantified
17.	(Lesson Structure) Specific  Skill Lesson (e.g. How many Duplicates are there?)
One specific skill for one specific question (often part of a larger problem)
Single Metric Answer Quantified
18.	Problems have concrete situational solutions, whereby you solve the puzzle and are able to proceed with the story or not.



### Notes:
1. "cut-up" style puzzles where, for a group activity, different users/students are given different parts of a large puzzle which they then communicate and collaborate to put together.

2. basic skills and full interview questions

3. solving a problem 'from scratch' without using built-in or public tools, etc. Python has many such high-level built-in functions, vs. learning to use the built-in tools. Maybe analogous to doing math with pen and paper at first before using functions built into calculators and software.  

4. automatic generation of new problems for practice?

5. Q: Files and folders? useful, but not usually included...
