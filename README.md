# Dungeon of Notebooks 

Dungeon of Notebooks is a blending of python notebooks, code-challenges or coding-interview puzzles, and story based games or RPG Dungeon games (role playing games).

Each notebook contains a traditional code challenge designed to teach and practice a programming skill. Each coding puzzle is framed in the context of a story scenario, so each code-puzzle is also a scene in a story. The idea is that a story will help to make the puzzle more concrete, interesting, and visibly applicable, and less arbitrary and meaningless. 

The plan is to offer a set of notebooks that cover code-interview and computer science curriculum skills and abilities. Challenges that elsewhere are one single more advanced challenge here may be broken up into parts. There will also be a theme of practice through cumulative repetition. The goal is not to solve one puzzle once, but to train to build habits around skills over time and many iterations. 

An example approach to covering a Computer Science, Programing, and Coding curriculum can be found here: https://github.com/lineality/cs-computer-science-curriculum 

Notes:
1. "cut-up" style puzzles where for a group activity different people are given different parts of a large puzzle to then put together.
2. automatic generation of new problems for practice?
