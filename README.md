# Dungeon of Notebooks 

Dungeon of Notebooks is a blending of python notebooks, code-challenge or coding-interview puzzles, and story based games.

Each notebook contains a traditional code challenge designed to teach and practice a programming skill. Each coding puzzle is framed in the context of a story scenario, so each code-puzzle is also a scene in a story.
