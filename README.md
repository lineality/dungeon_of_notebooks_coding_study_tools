Note: http://ReadMeAdventures.com/ or https://lineality.github.io/readmeadventures.github.io/ is story-based coding study tool. Read-Me-Adventures is focused on using command-line terminals rather than Notebooks, and focused on projects such as Natural Language Processing rather than interview question code challenges.

# Dungeon of Notebooks 

Dungeon of Notebooks is a blending of python notebooks, code-challenges or (coding-interview questions), and story based games or RPG Dungeon games (role playing games).

Each notebook contains a traditional code challenge designed to teach and practice a programming skill. Each coding puzzle is framed in the context of a story scenario, so each code-puzzle is also a scene in a story. The idea is that a story will help to make the puzzle more concrete, interesting, and visibly applicable, and less arbitrary and meaningless. 

The plan is to offer a set of notebooks that cover code-interview and computer science curriculum skills and abilities. Challenges that elsewhere are one single more advanced challenge here may be broken up into parts. There will also be a theme of practice through cumulative repetition. The goal is not to solve one puzzle once, but to train to build habits around skills over time and many iterations. 

An example approach to covering a Computer Science, Programing, and Coding curriculum can be found here: https://github.com/lineality/cs-computer-science-curriculum 

A draft 'intro / starter' notebook is here, to start story and introduce how notebooks are used:

Notes:
1. "cut-up" style puzzles where for a group activity different people are given different parts of a large puzzle to then put together.

2. basic skills and full interview questions

3. 'from scratch' and existing resource use

4. automatic generation of new problems for practice?
