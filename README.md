# Dungeon of Notebooks 

Dungeon of Notebooks is a blending of python notebooks, code-challenge or coding-interview puzzles, and story based games.

Each notebook contains a traditional code challenge designed to teach and practice a programming skill. Each coding puzzle is framed in the context of a story scenario, so each code-puzzle is also a scene in a story. The idea is that a story will help to make the puzzle more concrete, interesting, and visibly applicable, and less arbitrary and meaningless. 

The plan is to offer a set of notebooks that cover both code-interview topics and computer science curriculum topics. Challenges that elsewhere are one single more advanced challenge here may be broken up into parts. There will also be a theme of practice through cumulative repetition. The goal is not to solve one puzzle once, but to train to build habits around skills over time and many iterations.
