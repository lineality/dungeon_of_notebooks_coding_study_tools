## readme.md for dungeon_of_notebooks_coding_study_tools

*Note: The study tool described here is 'Dungeon of Notebooks'. A different but similar story-based coding-study tool is ReadMe-Adventures (LInked: http://ReadMeAdventures.com/ or https://lineality.github.io/readmeadventures.github.io/ ). Read-Me-Adventures is focused on using a command-line terminal and teaches topics such as Natural Language Processing.


# Dungeon of Notebooks 

Dungeon of Notebooks is a blend of python notebooks, code-challenges (coding-interview job-interview questions), and story based games or RPG Dungeon games (role playing games).

A "coding notebook" is a python notebook, either an online Google Colab notebook or a jupyter notebook (which could also run in an online service such as AWS or many others). 

*Note: The study tool described here is 'Dungeon of Notebooks'. A different but similar story-based coding-study tool is ReadMe-Adventures (LInked: http://ReadMeAdventures.com/ or https://lineality.github.io/readmeadventures.github.io/ ). Read-Me-Adventures is focused on using a command-line terminal and teaches topics such as Natural Language Processing.

Each coding-notebook contains a code-puzzle (or code challenge) designed to teach and practice a specific programming skill. Each code-puzzle is framed in the context of a story scenario, so each code-puzzle is also a scene in a story. The idea is that a story will help to make the puzzle more concrete, interesting, and applicable in real-life scenarios, and connected to the world we live in (or read about in literature). This should address the problem of code challenges being difficult to understand or solve when they are excessively arbitrary and disconnected. 

The plan is to offer a set of notebooks that cover a whole curriculum of code-interview and computer science skills and abilities. Challenges that elsewhere are one single more advanced challenge here may be broken up into smaller parts (before being cumulatively reviewed together). There will also be a theme of practice through cumulative repetition. There will be an option of additional practice puzzles in skill areas where students want more practice through repeated use (something advisable for everyone given the resource of time). The goal is not to solve one puzzle once and then never mention it again, but to train to build habits around applicable skills over time and many iterations because they are broadly applicable and repeated use deepens our skills and understanding.. 


# Notebooks:

An introductory notebook is here, to start the story and introduce how notebooks are used:

# Curricula 
Descriptions of a course-of-study often focus on one curriculum (singular) for the course, but in many cases the reality of teaching and learning in a course of study is managing multiple parallel curricula (plural). In this case (for Dungeon of Notebooks lessons) here are some example curricula to be managed all together (or in parallel):
1. standard technical interview questions for coding job interviews (computer programming)
2. code presentation, communication, repo management, blogging, and code 'refactoring'
3. General practical programing background skills from SQL and command line terminals to introductory computer science concepts (such as data types) 
4. Liberal Arts Culture and Literature
5. Scrum and Agile Best Practice Methods, Frameworks, Standards, and Procedures

An example approach to covering a Computer Science, Programing, and Coding curriculum can be found here: https://github.com/lineality/cs-computer-science-curriculum 

An example of an approach to integrating problem-solving-skills and team-coordination-project-skills together into lessons and study-materials is here:
https://github.com/lineality/adding_python_libraries_to_AWS_Lambda_function 
This combination of curricula is a high priority goal for Dungeon of Notebooks.

# Story Puzzles and Coding Challenges

1. Anyone can learn to solve coding-interview-problems.
2. Coding-interview-problems can be more clearly communicated about with a more concrete context.
3. Clear communication really is part of coding (and best-practice generally).

Code-Challenges (or 'Coding Interview Questions' or 'technical interview questions') can sometimes seem abstract and confusing due to a lack of concrete context for the problem being solved. (A side-problem is when people deliberately try to make the questions as confusing and unclear as possible.) 

Here in Dungeon-of-Notebooks, each Code-Challenge is explained in terms of a concrete story situation with a concrete and understandable outcome. For example,  you will deal with such things as a cast of characters, casts of creatures in dungeon rooms, enchanted items and tools, maps and pathways through the dungeon, scrolls of spells, and information about creatures or dungeon rooms, etc. Whether you are able to 'solve the problem' will ultimately mean, concretely, being able to get artifacts from a chest in a room. If you fail, you can clearly see how you failed in terms of what should have happened but did not happen in terms of concrete actions, items, and relationships in a coherent story setting. 


# How Spells & Elements work in Dungeon of Notebooks:

One of the first exciting questions when you go into any new RPG or fiction world involving spells, is "How do spells work in this world?"  

The system-mechanic for spells & enchantments in Dungeon-of-Notebooks uses a system of 'elemental-relationships' based on the eastern 5-element system, where each element helps one other element and hinders one other element. Each creature has an element, and each spell has an element. You will need to pick which element you use in each case to make sure the effect is what you plan on.

# Gameplay Workflow

Every "lesson" (an interview question) is a "level" in the dungeon, involving one or more rooms.
In each level there will be special items that you will need to get from chests in the dungeon rooms. To get to the chests there will be some practical problem that you will have to overcome.
To solve this practical problem you will have to develop a "function" to solve that problem.
When you solve the problem then you can get the items you need from the chests to complete that level. For example, a function that helps you to determine what kind of spell you need to cast.

The text and coding cells of the notebook will guide you through the story, and let you interact through text and graphical displays of the rooms and dungeon level.

The lesson will begin with where you are in the story, for example getting an assignment in the villages's university museum and then going down into the dungeon to have your adventure looking for what the museum needs. 

You will navigate the dungeon on your own (with a cast of 6 story-characters and ideally with one or two other human-players to work together as a team) to complete the task.

When you complete the task getting the items you need, the interface will alert you. 




# Interface: Graphics & Text, GUI & TUI
To help make events and outcomes concrete, there is a graphical display of what is happening in the dungeon room. In particular where the characters, creatures, and treasure chests are in rooms, and where you are and where rooms are in the dungeon level. For navigating freely around the dungeon level and in dungeon rooms, and deciding what to look at, there will be a Text-User-Interface (or TUI) where the player will type in their actions. 



# Puzzle & Activity Examples: 
#### Each puzzle will result in a successful or failed attempt to get to items from a chest in a dungeon-room. 


For example, the first-interview-question-based lesson (aside from tutorial and pre-requisite skill lessons) focuses on unique or duplicate items in lists and arrays. 

Other examples include:

1. Map & Directions puzzles
- strings 
- lists
- graphs 
- trees

2. Item Inventory Puzzles
- stacks
- queues

3. Team Strategy Puzzles
- linked lists
- chains of communication

4. cast of creatures puzzles
- comparing populations in rooms

5. dungeon rooms and spell effects
- matrices 

6. spell books:
- strings
- lists

Single Metric Answer Quantified
18. Problems have concrete situational solutions, whereby you solve the puzzle and are able to proceed with the story or not.



### Notes:
1. "cut-up" style puzzles: A good education activity tool designed for active-enguaged-learning on the part of the student is what is often called a 'cut-up' activity for small groups of students, where different students are given different parts of a larger puzzle which they then communicate and collaborate to put together.

2. basic skills and full interview questions

3. solving a problem 'from scratch' without using built-in or public tools, etc. Python has many such high-level built-in functions, vs. learning to use the built-in tools. Maybe analogous to doing math with pen and paper at first before using functions built into calculators and software.  

4. automatic generation of new problems for practice?

5. Q: Files and folders? useful, but not usually included...


## Questions to Guide the Choice of an Educational Course (e.g. for students, supervisors, parents, and teachers etc.):
1. What is the content?
2. What are the methods standards?
3. How is formative evaluation done?
4. How is summative evaluation done?
5. How are training and certification distinct?
6. Is the process inclusive on all levels?
7. How are data used in decision making?


## Portfolios, Github Repos, and Mini-Projects

The last step for each puzzle-level (after you have solved the technical challenge, gotten into the treasure chests, gotten your items, and finished the story episode) is to create a project repository (a "repo") for the coding-solution that you created in a git system such as github.

Basic steps are:
1. clone this repo
https://github.com/lineality/Code_Solution_For_TEMPLATE-YOUR-MINI-PROJECT-NAME-HERE

2. add a title and fill in the template to describe your solution
3. make a new repo for your solution (e.g. in Github)
4. upload your files
5. Write an article such as a blog post explaining how you solved the problem, for example teaching someone else how to do so. Teaching something is a core part of learning that thing.
